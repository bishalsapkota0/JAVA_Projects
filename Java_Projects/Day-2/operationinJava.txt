Operators in Java
 Symbols that tells compiler to perform some operations
  sum = a+b;
  a, b -> oprands
  + -> Operator

Types

Arthmetic operators
Relational operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
Assignment operators

Arthmetic Operator
Binary operators  : which need two oprands
+  eg. a+b 
-   eg. a-b
*   eg. a*b
/   eg. a/b
%   a%b gives remainder(modulo operators)

Unary Operator : sing oprands is enough
 ++ and --
 eg. a++ //increment operators
      e.g a= a + 1 ==> a++;
      or  ++and

      --a or a-- //decrement operators
      eg. a = a-1 ==> a--;

Pre increment //paila update
 ++a; 
 1. value change 
 2. value use
 eg ; a= 10
  b = ++a 
     ++a == a+1
      first a= a+1 then
      b= a(new)
hence a = 11;b=11
first a self change then value assin to b

Relational Operators
== equals
!= not equals
> is greater
< smaller
<= small or equals to
>= greater or equals to

Assignment Operator
 e.g A=B that is b ko value goes to A 
  a+=b => a= a+b;
  a-=b => a= a-b;

Logical Operator
&& (AND)
|| (OR)
! (NOT)
