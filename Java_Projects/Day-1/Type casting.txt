Type Casting
   : it is not allowed in java but we somehow manage to allow 
 eg. float a = 23.5
 int b = a; //generally this is not allowed in java
 ? 
 float a = 23.5
 int b = (int)a; //now b = 23 and is allowed is

 //converting from float to int is also possible in java as it has some unique numbers for each and every characters 
 eg. a =97
 b=98
 c=99 
 this is a series of numbers
