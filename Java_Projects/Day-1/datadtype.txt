two types of data type 
1; Primitive : already exist in java
byte
short
char
boolean
int
long
float
double
 2. Non Primitive
 String
 array
 class
 object
 interface

// Java is a typed language
that means we have to tell that which type of date is being defined ; 
eg. int a = 1;
     string name= " bishal";

// Java is a strict language more the strict more secure is the data 

byte type data is quite similar to int // only 256 numbers are stored
char ch= 'a' //char is used for single  character data type
boolean variable = true; //or boolean variable = false; // to check condition
float price= 10.5;
int a =10; //to store whole value
long //big integer 
double  // big float
short n = 240;


size of data types
 1 byte= 8 bits [256 numbers can be stored]
       1 bit = either 0 or 1;
 short 2 bytes
 char 2 bytes
 int 4 bytes [-2Billion to +2 Billion]
 long 8 bytes
 float 4 bytes
 double 8 bytes
